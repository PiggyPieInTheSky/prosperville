# Prosperville Source Code

This is the source code folder for Prosperville. The python environment in which the code is developed is Python 3.11. Because the graphic user interface can only work on a Jupyter Notebook, you will also need the JupyterLab to run the game. The basic Python packages that are used in the development environment is documented in requirements.txt. In your local environment, as long as the package are compatible in Python 3.11 or higher, their versions don't have to match what's in the requirements.txt.

The main entry file for the game is Prosperville.ipynb. Please refer to:
- game_manual.pdf for how the game works as a board game
- code_doc.pdf for an overview of the code base
